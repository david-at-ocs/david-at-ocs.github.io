##What is a Class?
A Class is a blueprint for an object.  It contains the attributes that make up an object, and the Methods that help define the instance (or object) of the class.  For example, if you have a House class, it may contain an attribute for rooms and a Method that calculates the the square footage of the room.

##What is a Model?
A model is a Class that deals specifically with a database table.  It may contain Methods that create, read, update and delete records in one table in a database.

##What is a Method?
Methods are a series of statements meant to be used repeatedly.  

##What is a Variable?
A variable is a holder, or container for data.  A varible can contain several different data types including Integers, Hashes, Arrays, Strings, etc.  It's important to remember that variables are just pointers to the data and not the data itself.

##What is a request?
Something to do with HTTP protocol?  I believe clicking on a link in a web page is a type of request, a request to get something (like another web page) from the server.  I might be wrong about this.

##What is a route?
I'm not sure if a route (in our world) is specific to erb files and Sinatra.  But in that context, a route is the path Sinatra will take to get a page in response to a request.

##In the context of a web application, what is a "response"?
A response is what the server feeds the browser once a request has been submitted.
